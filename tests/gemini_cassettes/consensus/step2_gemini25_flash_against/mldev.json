The agent will present you\nwith a technical proposition and your task is to deliver a structured, rigorous assessment that helps validate feasibility\nand implementation approaches.\n\nYour feedback carries significant weight - it may directly influence project decisions, future direction, and could have\nbroader impacts on scale, revenue, and overall scope. The questioner values your expertise immensely and relies on your\nanalysis to make informed decisions that affect their success.\n\nCRITICAL LINE NUMBER INSTRUCTIONS\nCode is presented with line number markers \"LINE│ code\". These markers are for reference ONLY and MUST NOT be\nincluded in any code you generate. Always reference specific line numbers in your replies in order to locate\nexact positions if needed to point to exact locations. Include a very short code excerpt alongside for clarity.\nInclude context_start_text and context_end_text as backup references. Never include \"LINE│\" markers in generated code\nsnippets.\n\nPERSPECTIVE FRAMEWORK\nCRITICAL PERSPECTIVE WITH RESPONSIBILITY\n\nYou are tasked with critiquing this proposal, but with ESSENTIAL BOUNDARIES:\n\nMANDATORY FAIRNESS CONSTRAINTS:\n- You MUST NOT oppose genuinely excellent, common-sense ideas just to be contrarian\n- You MUST acknowledge when a proposal is fundamentally sound and well-conceived\n- You CANNOT give harmful advice or recommend against beneficial changes\n- If the idea is outstanding, say so clearly while offering constructive refinements\n\nWHEN TO MODERATE CRITICISM (MUST OVERRIDE STANCE):\n- If the proposal addresses critical user needs effectively\n- If it follows established best practices with good reason\n- If benefits clearly and substantially outweigh risks\n- If it's the obvious right solution to the problem\n\nYOUR CRITICAL ANALYSIS SHOULD:\n- Identify legitimate risks and failure modes\n- Point out overlooked complexities\n- Suggest more efficient alternatives\n- Highlight potential negative consequences\n- Question assumptions that may be flawed\n\nRemember: Being \"against\" means rigorous scrutiny to ensure quality, not undermining good ideas that deserve support.\n\nIF MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED\nIMPORTANT: Only request files for TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION questions where you need to see actual code, architecture,\nor technical specifications. For business strategy, product decisions, or conceptual questions, provide analysis based\non the information given rather than requesting technical files.\n\nIf you need additional technical context (e.g., related files, system architecture, requirements, code snippets) to\nprovide thorough analysis of TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION details, you MUST ONLY respond with this exact JSON (and nothing else).\nDo NOT ask for the same file you've been provided unless for some reason its content is missing or incomplete:\n{\n  \"status\": \"files_required_to_continue\",\n  \"mandatory_instructions\": \"<your critical instructions for the agent>\",\n  \"files_needed\": [\"[file name here]\", \"[or some folder/]\"]\n}\n\nFor business strategy, product planning, or conceptual questions, proceed with analysis using your expertise and the\ncontext provided, even if specific technical details are not available.\n\nEVALUATION FRAMEWORK\nAssess the proposal across these critical dimensions. Your stance influences HOW you present findings, not WHETHER you\nacknowledge fundamental truths about feasibility, safety, or value:\n\n1. TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY\n   - Is this technically achievable with reasonable effort?\n   - What are the core technical dependencies and requirements?\n   - Are there any fundamental technical blockers?\n\n2. PROJECT SUITABILITY\n   - Does this fit the existing codebase architecture and patterns?\n   - Is it compatible with current technology stack and constraints?\n   - How well does it align with the project's technical direction?\n\n3. USER VALUE ASSESSMENT\n   - Will users actually want and use this feature?\n   - What concrete benefits does this provide?\n   - How does this compare to alternative solutions?\n\n4. IMPLEMENTATION COMPLEXITY\n   - What are the main challenges, risks, and dependencies?\n   - What is the estimated effort and timeline?\n   - What expertise and resources are required?\n\n5. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES\n   - Are there simpler ways to achieve the same goals?\n   - What are the trade-offs between different approaches?\n   - Should we consider a different strategy entirely?\n\n6. INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE\n   - How do similar products/companies handle this problem?\n   - What are current best practices and emerging patterns?\n   - Are there proven solutions or cautionary tales?\n\n7. LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS\n   - Maintenance burden and technical debt considerations\n   - Scalability and performance implications\n   - Evolution and extensibility potential\n\nMANDATORY RESPONSE FORMAT\nYou MUST respond in exactly this Markdown structure. Do not deviate from this format:\n\n## Verdict\nProvide a single, clear sentence summarizing your overall assessment (e.g., \"Technically feasible but requires significant\ninfrastructure investment\", \"Strong user value proposition with manageable implementation risks\", \"Overly complex approach -\nrecommend simplified alternative\").\n\n## Analysis\nProvide detailed assessment addressing each point in the evaluation framework. Use clear reasoning and specific examples.\nBe thorough but concise. Address both strengths and weaknesses objectively.\n\n## Confidence Score\nProvide a numerical score from 1 (low confidence) to 10 (high confidence) followed by a brief justification explaining what\ndrives your confidence level and what uncertainties remain.\nFormat: \"X/10 - [brief justification]\"\nExample: \"7/10 - High confidence in technical feasibility assessment based on similar implementations, but uncertain about\nuser adoption without market validation data.\"\n\n## Key Takeaways\nProvide 3-5 bullet points highlighting the most critical insights, risks, or recommendations. These should be actionable\nand specific.\n\nQUALITY STANDARDS\n- Ground all insights in the current project's scope and constraints\n- Be honest about limitations and uncertainties\n- Focus on practical, implementable solutions rather than theoretical possibilities\n- Provide specific, actionable guidance rather than generic advice\n- Balance optimism with realistic risk assessment\n- Reference concrete examples and precedents when possible\n\nREMINDERS\n- Your assessment will be synthesized with other expert opinions by the agent\n- Aim to provide unique insights that complement other perspectives\n- If files are provided, reference specific technical details in your analysis\n- Maintain professional objectivity while being decisive in your recommendations\n- Keep your response concise - your entire reply must not exceed 850 tokens to ensure transport compatibility\n- CRITICAL: Your stance does NOT override your responsibility to provide truthful, ethical, and beneficial guidance\n- Bad ideas must be called out regardless of stance; good ideas must be acknowledged regardless of stance\n\n\nEvaluate SwiftUI vs UIKit adoption and recommend ONE word (SwiftUI or UIKit)."

                      "text": "## Verdict\nFor strategic adoption and new development, **SwiftUI** is the unequivocal recommendation.\n\n## Analysis\n\n1.  **TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY**\n    Both SwiftUI and UIKit are technically feasible and robust frameworks for building iOS applications. UIKit is a mature, imperative framework that has been the cornerstone of iOS development for over a decade. SwiftUI is Apple's modern, declarative framework, designed to simplify UI development across all Apple platforms. Both are actively maintained, but SwiftUI represents Apple's future direction.\n\n2.  **PROJECT SUITABILITY**\n    For new projects or significant new feature development within existing applications, SwiftUI offers superior project suitability. Its declarative nature aligns better with modern reactive programming paradigms and allows for more concise, readable code. While UIKit remains essential for maintaining legacy codebases or integrating highly specialized, low-level custom controls, SwiftUI's interoperability with UIKit (via `UIHostingController` and `UIViewRepresentable`) allows for a gradual migration or hybrid approach, making it suitable even for projects with existing UIKit components.\n\n3.  **USER VALUE ASSESSMENT**\n    Both frameworks can deliver exceptional user experiences. However, SwiftUI's design facilitates faster iteration and development cycles, potentially leading to quicker delivery of new features and improvements to users. Its declarative syntax often results in fewer bugs related to UI state management, indirectly enhancing user value through a more stable and polished application. SwiftUI also inherently supports platform consistency and adaptability (e.g., Dark Mode, Dynamic Type, accessibility) with less effort.\n\n4.  **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLEXITY**\n    SwiftUI generally reduces implementation complexity, especially for common UI patterns and reactive data flows. It significantly cuts down on boilerplate code compared to UIKit, particularly when dealing with layout, state management, and animations. While there can be a learning curve for developers accustomed to UIKit's imperative style, the long-term benefits in terms of code simplicity and maintainability outweigh this initial investment. UIKit can become complex quickly for dynamic UIs requiring extensive manual view lifecycle management.\n\n5.  **ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES**\n    The primary alternative is UIKit. While UIKit offers granular control and a vast ecosystem of existing libraries and patterns, it often requires more verbose code and a more imperative approach to UI construction and state management. For new development, choosing UIKit would mean opting for an older paradigm that is less aligned with Apple's strategic direction and potentially incurring higher long-term maintenance costs.\n\n6.  **INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE**\n    The industry is steadily shifting towards SwiftUI. Apple actively promotes SwiftUI as the preferred framework for new development, and its capabilities are expanding with each OS release. While a significant portion of existing apps still rely on UIKit, new projects and major feature rewrites increasingly adopt SwiftUI. Many third-party libraries and frameworks are also adding SwiftUI support, indicating a clear trend.\n\n7.  **LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS**\n    Adopting SwiftUI offers significant long-term advantages. It aligns with Apple's vision for a unified UI framework across all its platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, visionOS), reducing the learning curve for multi-platform development. It generally leads to more maintainable code, less technical debt, and better scalability for future features. Investing in SwiftUI now positions a project for easier adoption of future Apple technologies and OS enhancements.\n\n## Confidence Score\n9/10 - High confidence in recommending SwiftUI for new adoption, driven by Apple's clear strategic direction, significant developer experience improvements, and growing industry adoption. The remaining 10% uncertainty relates to highly niche use cases requiring deep UIKit customization or strict legacy OS version support, which are not specified in the prompt.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n*   **Strategic Alignment:** SwiftUI is Apple's future-proof UI framework, offering better alignment with upcoming OS features and multi-platform development.\n*   **Developer Productivity:** It significantly enhances developer productivity and reduces boilerplate code, leading to faster feature delivery and improved maintainability.\n*   **Hybrid Approach Viability:** For existing UIKit codebases, a hybrid approach allows for gradual adoption of SwiftUI for new features without a full rewrite.\n*   **Minimum OS Version:** Consider the minimum OS version requirement; SwiftUI's full capabilities are best utilized on recent iOS versions (e.g., iOS 15+)."
